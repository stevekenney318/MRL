Import live, calculating spreadsheets from Microsoft Excel to WordPress. The uploaded online spreadsheet is live, and looks and feels like in Excel.

== Description ==

**Import Spreadsheets from Microsoft Excel** is a WordPress plugin that allows you to import live, calculating spreadsheets from Microsoft Excel to your blog or website in WordPress. The plugin is free but the calculating web page must have been generated with a paid license for [SpreadsheetConverter](http://www.spreadsheetconverter.com/ "Link to the SpreadsheetConverter web site"), an add-in for Excel that converts the Excel spreadsheet to HTML and the formulas in Excel to JavaScript. The uploaded online spreadsheet is live and looks and feels exactly like in Excel. Now you can use Excel everywhere!

SpreadsheetConverter works like an Excel compiler creating live online spreadsheets in HTML and JavaScript. It is not a simple Excel viewer; the web spreadsheet plugin runs all your formulas in real-time - all the cells and charts are live! 

You usually need to have **your own WordPress server** to install plugins. It may not be possible to install plugins on WordPress.com or other shared WordPress servers. If you are unable to use this plugin, you can use our [Publish to Cloud](https://help.spreadsheetconverter.com/support/online-help/publish-to-cloud "Link to the Publish to Cloud help page") service instead. It is built into SpreadsheetConverter and uploads the calculator to a cloud server. In most cases, this works just as well.

Note: before you upload a spreadsheet, you must use [the SpreadsheetConverter add-in for Microsoft Excel](http://www.spreadsheetconverter.com/ "Link to the SpreadsheetConverter web site") to convert your spreadsheet to web format. To use this add-in, you must have Microsoft Excel 2007 or later for Windows - and the basic skills to create spreadsheets with it. Prices for unlimited, lifetime licenses for the current version start at $254. There are no extra fees per server, month, page or visitor.

We’d love to help you try SpreadsheetConverter on one of your own spreadsheets. You don’t have to install the software to test it. Just send one of your own spreadsheets, and we’ll send it back as a live, intelligent web form or calculator. Use [the online form](https://www.spreadsheetconverter.com/news/free-demo/ "Link to the free-trial information page for for SpreadsheetConverter") and remember to attach the spreadsheet!

This service is free, because it’s so simple to convert your spreadsheet to web format with SpreadsheetConverter that we can do it in almost no time at all. If you want to keep your web calculator or form up-to-date without ever installing or learning the converter, you can have us do all the conversion work for you, forever, using [the paid conversion service](https://www.spreadsheetconverter.com/products/one-calculating-web-form-from-an-excel-sheet/ "Link to the product page for paid one-time conversions").

SpreadsheetConverter is an advanced product that may require some time to learn. If you don't want to invest in this new skill set right now, you can test the plugin right now with example files in the plugin's ZIP file - read more below. 

Please don’t post negative reviews until you have at least read the FAQ. Even better: contact support for any difficulties you have; we will help you get started for free!

== Uploading instruction ==

You upload the result of the conversion in SpreadsheetConverter to WordPress in the form of an **SSC Calculator file**. The SSC Calculator file contains everything that WordPress needs to run the calculator.

= Uploading a new calculator =

Follow these instructions only when you upload a new calculator for the first time. If you later want to update an existing calculator that you have already uploaded at least once to WordPress, there are separate instructions below.

= Creating the SSC Calculator file =

With the plugin, you get two example files, one that you will use for this initial upload and one for the update described below. 

= Uploading the SSC Calculator file =

1. In WordPress, locate the **Upload SSC Calculator** link in your WordPress menu. If you don't see this link, please verify that you have installed the plugin correctly according to the instructions above.
1. Click on **Upload SSC Calculator**, then **Add New** if you are about to upload a new calculator that you haven't uploaded before. 
1. Enter a unique, descriptive name for this particular calculator in the **Enter calculator name** field. For the example file, you can use **Weekly Time Card**. 
1. Click on **Choose Package** and select the SSC Calculator file. The example file provided with the plugin is in the **examples > 1-upload** folder of the plugin ZIP. Locate the **weekly-time-card.zip** file, select it and press **Open**. 
1. Press the **Publish** button and the SSC Calculator file will be uploaded to WordPress. It will not be visible in any post or page until you embed it (read more below). 

== Embedding instructions ==

Before you embed a spreadsheet, you must follow the steps above to upload the SSC Calculator file to WordPress. Now, it's time to embed the calculator in one or more web pages.

= Using the Block editor =

To insert a converted spreadsheet in WordPress using the Block editor:

1. In WordPress, click on the **Upload SSC Calculator** link in the menu.
1. In the list of calculators, locate the calculator you want to embed. 
1. In the column **Calculator iframe**, click on the **Click to Copy** button for the calculator you want to embed. This copies the complete embed code to the clipboard.
1. Open the Block editor for the page or post where you want the uploaded calculator to appear.
1. Click on the plus sign to insert a new block. Type "html" in the search box and select to insert a **Custom HTML** block.

1. Select the **HTML** view for the Custom HTML block.
1. Paste the embed code HTML into the Custom HTML block with Ctrl+V or right mouseclick+Paste.
1. Select the **Preview** view for the block. 
1. If you cannot see the entire calculator, or if scrollbars appear, or if there's too much whitespace around the calculator, you may need to adjust the size of the iframe. Select the **HTML** view for the Custom HTML block, adjust the **height** and **width** parameters in the **table id="hasIframe"** tag that represents the calculator, switching back and forth to the **Preview** tab until the calculator looks good. Don't be afraid of leaving a considerable margin around the calculator.
1. Save your changes by clicking **Publish**.
1. If you want to use an uploaded calculator on more than one page, just repeat the above once for every page where you want it to appear. 

= Using the Classic editor =

To insert a converted spreadsheet in WordPress using the Classic editor:

1. Open the Classic editor for the page or post where you want the uploaded calculator to appear.
1. Place the cursor at the right spot and click **Embed SSC Calculator**.
1. In the list called **Calculator Link**, scroll to and select the calculator you want to embed.
1. If necessary, modify the size of the calculator frame in the web page using the fields **Iframe Width** and **Iframe Height**. Click **Insert Calculator**.
1. If you don’t see the calculator, only a set of HTML tags, click on the **Visual** tab for a preview of the page.
1. If you cannot see the entire calculator, or if scrollbars appear, or if there's too much whitespace around the calculator, you may need to adjust the size of the iframe. On the **Visual** tab, drag the handle to resize the calculator frame. For better control, switch to the **Text** tab, adjust the **height** and **width** parameters in the **table id="hasIframe"** tag that represents the calculator, switching back and forth to the **Visual** tab until the calculator looks good. Don't be afraid of leaving a considerable margin around the calculator. 
1. Save your changes by clicking **Publish**.
1. If you want to use an uploaded calculator on more than one page, just repeat the above once for every page where you want it to appear.

== Updating an existing calculator ==

If you want to update an existing calculator that you have already uploaded at least once to WordPress, follow these instructions.

= Creating the SSC Calculator file =

With the plugin, you get two example files, one that you used above for the initial upload and one that you can use now for the update. 

= Uploading the SSC Calculator file =

1. In WordPress, locate the **Upload SSC Calculator** link in your WordPress menu. If you don't see this link, please verify that you have installed the plugin correctly.
1. Click on **Upload SSC Calculator** in the WordPress menu, then **All Calculators**. 
1. Move the mouse cursor over the title of the calculator you want to update, so that its menu links appear. Click on the **Edit** link. 
1. Click **Choose Package** and select the updated SSC Calculator ZIP file in the **examples > 2-update** folder of the plugin ZIP. 
1. Press **Update**. The new version is uploaded and automatically used instead of the old one, in all pages and posts that you have already embedded it.

= Caching may delay updates to your web pages =

If an update to a calculator does not immediately appear on the web or in the preview in the plugin, it may be a result of caching, which is beyond our control. Caching typically introduces a delay of 1-48 hours in the publishing of new or updated web content. When you test static web content like uploaded calculators, you can try adding a fake “version” parameter to the link to the calculator:

    https://example.com/calculator.html?version=1

When you update the calculator, just remember to change also the version number in the links to it, which should force the cache to fetch the updated content. Note: you only need the *version* parameter during testing, to verify that the update went through correctly. In your production environment, the updated version will be loaded slightly later as the cached copies of the previous version expire.

The SSC Calculator file is created after the conversion of the spreadsheet to web format, using the **WordPress plugin** dialog. By default, it is located in **Documents > SpreadsheetConverter**. If your calculator is called **weekly-time-card.xlsx**, there will be a folder called **weekly-time-card** with your converted calculator.

Scroll down past the folder to the **weekly-time-card.zip** file, select it and press **Open**.

= I have selected an SSC Calculator ZIP file but there is no Upload button. =
Sorry, WordPress requires the button to be labeled **Publish**. Press the **Publish** button and the SSC Calculator file will be uploaded to WordPress. It will not be visible in any post or page until you embed it.

Don't be afraid of leaving a considerable margin around your calculator.

= There is a large black toolbar at the bottom of my calculator. How do I remove it? =
If you don't want the calculator to include a toolbar, or if you want to select other buttons for the toolbar, you need to adjust the **Workbook** settings in SpreadsheetConverter. Uncheck all buttons in the **Workbook > Toolbar** section and unselect **Enable Real-time Sync** in **Workbook > Web Page Options**. Convert the spreadsheet again and update it in WordPress.

= I want the calculator to appear at the bottom of the page. =

= I want to remove a calculator that I previously embedded in “page A”, because I have moved it to “page B”. =
Edit “page A”. If you are using the **Block** editor, simply remove the Custom HTML block. If you are using the **Classic** editor, switch to the **Text** tab, remove the entire "hasIframe" table, from the **table id="hasIframe"** statement to the **/table** statement.

= I was editing my page and now the web form no longer appears. =
You may have deleted the embed code by mistake. HTML code may also disappear when you switch between the Block editor and the Classic editor. Just embed the web form again using the instructions above. 

= I want to use an uploaded calculator on more than one web page, can I do that? =
Of course! You can embed a calculator on as many posts or pages as you like.  

= I created a web form but it always appears left-adjusted. How can I right-adjust it and place text to the left of the form? =
You need to create a two-column layout for your page. Search the web for *wordpress tutorial two columns* to get help on how you create a two-column layout first, then move the embed code to the correct location in your two-column design. 

= I have created a calculator and it works fine in my blog. Since then I have edited the spreadsheet in Excel and converted it again. How do I update all the pages on the website that are using the old version, to use the new version instead? =
In WordPress, click on **Upload SSC Calculator**, then **All Calculators**. Move the mouse cursor over the title of the calculator you want to update, so that its menu links appear. Click on the **Edit** link. Click **Choose Package** and select the SSC Calculator ZIP file from the the most recent conversion. Press **Publish**. The new version is uploaded and automatically used instead of the old one. If you have changed the dimensions of the calculator, you may want to adjust the **height** and **width** parameters of the embed code in each page (it is visible and editable on the **Text** tab) until the calculator looks good. If your WordPress site uses advanced caching, you may have to clear the cache to activate the updated calculator.

= I uploaded a calculator to WordPress but I won’t be using it. How can I delete it? =
Click on **Upload SSC Calculator**, then **All Calculators**. Move the mouse cursor over the title of the calculator you want to update, so that its menu links appear. Click on the **Trash** link. If you want to delete two or more calculators, you can also tick the checkbox for all calculators that you want to delete, select **Move to Trash** in the **Bulk Actions** menu and press **Apply**.

= I deleted a calculator by mistake and now I want it back. =
This is how you restore it from the Trash: click on **Upload SSC Calculator**, then **All Calculators**. Just above the first calculator in the list, you will see links for **All**, **Published**, **Drafts** and **Trash**. Click on the **Trash** link. Locate the calculator you want to restore in the list and click on its **Restore** link. If there is no **Trash** link, or if your calculator is no longer in the Trash, it is because calculators automatically get deleted by WordPress after 30 days in the Trash. If you still have the SSC Calculator file you can just upload it again. 

= I am creating a blog entry for a presentation I’m going to give. I want to include a simple sign-up list for people that want to participate in my presentation. There are only 20 seats. How do I enable the Real-Time Sync feature so that everybody can see all previously registered participants? =
Create the sign-up form as a spreadsheet in Excel, with column headings for all the information you need about each participant, e.g. Seat, Name, Department and Phone. Fill twenty rows with the numbers 1-20 in the Seat column. Insert **Text** widgets in all other cells you wish your participants to enter data into, i.e. the Name, Department and Phone cell for each Seat. Convert the spreadsheet with SpreadsheetConverter, upload the ZIP file to WordPress and embed the sign-up form in your blog post. Before you publish the post, switch to the **Text** tab and locate the iframe tag that represents the sign-up form. Add **?k=presentation** at the end of the iframe’s **src** parameter. Example: if the link to the sign-up list ends with **/sign-up.htm**, change it to **/sign-up.htm?k=presentation**. All visitors now share a common list. As people add their names to the list, everybody can see who else registered for your presentation. This also makes it easy for you to know when the event is fully booked.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 10.1 =

Starting with version 10.1 we support the  Gutenberg Block editor in both WordPress version 4 and 5, with seamless switching to/from the Classic editor. Unfortunately, we have identified **a major issue with the Classic editor in Google Chrome**. We don't know why this problem occurs or how to avoid it. We will continue to investigate this, but we urgently need to release a version of this plugin that is compatible with WordPress 5 and we believe that most users will be unaffected by the problem anyhow.  

The problem we have seen during testing with Google Chrome version 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit) is that an embedded calculator may disappear from the page/post that is being edited.

1. In the Classic editor, the embedded calculator may be lost when you switch between the Visual and Text editing modes.
2. In the Classic editor, the embedded calculator may be lost when you are in the Visual mode, then click on the calculator iframe, then click outside the iframe.

If you are affected by the issue, you will suddenly notice that the embedded calculator no longer appears in the page or post. The converted spreadsheet is still securely saved as a calculating web page in your WordPress environment and continues to work fine in all other places where you have embedded it. The only thing you have to do if this happens to you is to switch to the Block editor and simply insert the embed code again. 

Please note that you will be completely unaffected by this issue 

* if you don't use Google Chrome,
* if you do use Google Chrome but never fall back to the old Classic editor, 
* if you use the Classic editor in Google Chrome but don't perform any of the actions that are known to make calculators disappear. 

Please use whatever circumvention you find best for you until we hopefully resolve this issue.  

= 10.0.1 =

You must use the same major version of the WordPress plugin as your SpreadsheetConverter license is for. Version 10 of the plugin only works with SSC Calculator files created by SpreadsheetConverter version 10.
