    <h1>2024 Rules</h1>
    <p><span class="numbered">1 –</span> <span class="numbered-text">There are 36 NASCAR Points Events this season.</span></p>
    <p>The season has been divided into 4 segments:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Segment #1 will consist of 8 races</li>
        <li>Segments #2 and #3 will consist of 9 races each.</li>
        <li>The final segment is the “Playoff” and will consist of 10 races.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="numbered">2 –</span> <span class="numbered-text">Each player will create a team of 4 drivers for each segment using the online submission form found on your team page.</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each team must consist of one driver from each Group (A, B, C, D). You then own those 4 drivers for that quarter.</li>
        <li>You can use a driver for ONE quarter only. After you use that driver he is no longer available to you.</li>
        <li>Upon submission, your picks will be reflected on your team page automatically. Your picks are official at that time. You can still make changes by re-selecting drivers at any time, until the form is locked, which will be just prior to the first race of the segment. Specific date and time will appear on your team page.</li>
        <li>Your Team Name will carry over from year to year. If you wish to change it for the current year, eMail us at <a href="mailto:ManliusRacingLeague@gmail.com">ManliusRacingLeague@gmail.com</a> with your new name.</li>
        <li>New players (Team Owners) must provide us with Team Name prior to choosing team.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="numbered">3 –</span> <span class="numbered-text">Scoring</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player will accumulate the total points that the drivers on your team receive from NASCAR.</li>
        <li>Please note that you are picking a driver and not a team. If your driver does not make the race – “NO POINTS”.</li>
        <li>If your driver is permanently removed from the car by the team owner after taking 2 races without points, you can replace that driver for another. Send the request to <a href="mailto:manliusracingleague@gmail.com">manliusracingleague@gmail.com</a>. It will be reviewed and all teams will be notified of any changes.</li>
        <li>NOTE: Each team is allowed only one “replacement” per year.</li>
        <li>You DO NOT receive the “adjustment” points awarded during the Playoff Format.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="numbered">4 –</span> <span class="numbered-text">Points will be totaled for each quarter and for the entire year. Payouts are as follows:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>36 weekly high scores</li>
        <li>8 segment winners (1st and 2nd place all 4 segments)</li>
        <li>3 yearly winners (1st, 2nd, 3rd place)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="numbered">5 –</span> <span class="numbered-text">Updates will be weekly (or as often as possible).</span></p>
    <p>Good Luck!</p>
